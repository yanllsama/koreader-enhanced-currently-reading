# 📖 Enhanced Currently Reading (SimpleUI Dashboard Module)

Enhanced Currently Reading is a completely redesigned, highly detailed, and fully dynamic reading statistics dashboard module. This module (`module_currently_yanllsama.lua`) is built as an extension for the `simpleui_ext.koplugin` to provide a premium, modern reading dashboard on KOReader.

While maintaining the solid foundation of the original concept, it offers enriched data, gorgeous modern design, dynamic grid management, vertical progress tracking, and flexible interface options. It features a crash-safe architecture fully compatible with the KOReader UI engine.

## ✨ Features

### 🎨 Modern & Aesthetic Design
* **Redesigned UI**: Enjoy a premium, modern layout where statistics and vertical bars are elegantly grouped inside a thinly outlined, rounded capsule-style table.
* **Full Typographic Control**: Completely customize the font family, font size, and font weight (Normal/Bold) for Book Titles, Author Names, Labels, and Data Numbers.
* **Pill-Shaped Progress Bars**: Visually pleasing, fully rounded capsule-style vertical bars. 

### 🖼️ Seamless CoverDeck Integration
* **Visual Harmony**: Integrates perfectly with CoverDeck to fetch and display high-quality book covers directly on your KOReader home screen.
* **Gesture Controls**: Simply use a **swipe up/down gesture** on the cover image area to smoothly interact with the CoverDeck features!

### 📈 Vertical Progress Bars & Daily Goals
* **Daily Page Goal**: Set a daily reading target (e.g., 50 pages) and watch your progress fill up a dedicated vertical bar.
* **Adjustable Bar Thickness**: Choose from 4 different thickness levels (Thin, Normal, Bold, Extra Bold) for your vertical bars.

### 📐 Fully Dynamic Grid System
* **Custom Layouts**: Say goodbye to fixed templates! Freely determine the layout of the statistics on your screen by selecting the Number of Columns (1-3) and Number of Rows (1-5).
* **Customizable Category Headers**: Change the text of the column headers (e.g., THIS BOOK, SPEED, EXTRA 1). You can also adjust the header thickness (Thin, Medium, Bold) or hide them completely.

### 📊 Rich Statistics
Deeply analyze your reading habits with:
* Time Left & Time Spent
* Pages Read & Pages Left
* Days Reading & Days to Go
* Daily Average & Pages/Minute Speed
* Last Session Pages

### 🎛️ Full Control (Edit Items)
* **Toggle & Sort**: Show or hide any statistic you want. Rearrange the display order exactly as you like. Your dynamic grid will automatically populate based on this order.

### ℹ️ Smart Info Screen & Insights
* **Book Blurb**: Avoids cluttering the screen with buttons. Tap on the Book or Author name to open an elegant info window displaying the book's blurb/summary.
* **Reading Insights**: Tap directly on the statistics area to bring up the detailed Reading Insights popup (if the patch is installed).
